Overview:
The  Placement Prediction System, where student can estimate their chances of securing on-campus placements, considering several parameters such as Stream, CGPA, Internship, Backlogs and more. Students can estimate their results within few clicks by submitting thier scores. The GUI use the machine learning model to analyze the input parameters. The dataset downloaded from the www.Kaggle.com for testing.

Features:
By leveraging the Logistic Regression Classification technique, the model has been train to analyze the input parameters and makes predictions ragarding the outcome.


Tech Stack:
Python.
Tkinter framework.
Jupyter Notebook.











This project is based on Placement prediction and its frontend is made using Tkinter. I did necessary Data Exploration, preprocessing and them trained the model using Logistic regression. then its frontend was designed using Tkinter(python GUI) and it give you answer based on your inputs that either a candidate is placed or not.
